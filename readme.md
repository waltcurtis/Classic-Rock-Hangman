# Overview
This project, word-search-game, has a **classic rock** theme.  The words to be guessed are the names of artists in that genre of music.

# Content
Main contents of this game are:
1. index.html -- the main web page of the game
2. style.css -- css file for stylizing the webpage
3. game.js -- the javascript code behind the functions on the webpage
4. artists.js -- a javascript data file of the artist objects to be used in gameplay (this *data javascript* is separate from the *code javascript* just to keep the code as small and clean as possible)
5. assets/songs -- clipped music for adding sound to the game [I need to return to this to determine if I have performed any copyright infringements by putting the game together using these song snippets]

Onscreen instructions should be self-explanatory for game-play.
